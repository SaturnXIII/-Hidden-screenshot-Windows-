###### hello, I created a script for takes screenshots every 15 seconds invisibly. Then who encrypts them.📸(🔥TOTAL FUD🔥) ######
> ## Information🔍 ##
the script uses boxcutter created by: https://github.com/mdrasmus/boxcutter to take a screenshot every 15sec and then encrypt the photo in base64 in a file generated when the script is launched. 
To recover the files you just have to copy them and decrypt them with the decoder.

For start launch execute.exe
You can create a shortcut in the windows start menu so that the script launches automatically when windows starts.

For decrypt move execute-decode.bat and decode.ps1 to the target folder and run execute-decode.bat.
