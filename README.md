###### hello, I created a script for takes screenshots every 15 seconds invisibly. Then who encrypts them.üì∏ ######
> ## Informationüîç ##
the script uses boxcutter created by: https://github.com/mdrasmus/boxcutterto take a screenshot every 15sec and then encrypt the photo in base64 in a file generated when the script is launched. 
To recover the files you just have to copy them and decrypt them with the decoder.
